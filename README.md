# skeleton-codename
Semester project, a silly 2D game made to try out the Unity engine.

It is in a playable state, features robots that fall apart into pieces, weapons that do way too little damage, a custom sprite animating system of dubious optimization, a custom dialog screen that is way too slow and a sprite block tiling system to save time from having to place backgrounds and platforms by hand.

WSAD to move, S while moving to sprint. QE to change inventory, F to interact, G to drop items.
